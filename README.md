# Harden
Palo Alto Networks Hardening Script

You will need Python and Requests installed.
I recommend using 'sudo apt install python-pip' and 'sudo pip install requests' to handle the dependencies.

From there, make sure the script is executable using 'chmod 755 harden.py' and you can run the script using './harden.py'
